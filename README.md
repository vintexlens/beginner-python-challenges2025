## Beginner Python Challenges

This repository contains simple Python coding challenges that I solved while learning Python.

Each file focuses on basic concepts like:
- Input and output
- If-else conditions
- Loops
- Error handling (try-except)
- Functions

## Challenges Included
- Grade Calculator: Takes a score and outputs the grade (A, B, C, etc.)
- Area of a rectangle
- Emojis
- (More challenges coming soon!)

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your IDE (like PyCharm).
3. Run the `.py` files individually to test each challenge.

## Why I Made This
I'm practicing Python by solving beginner-friendly problems and improving my coding skills step by step.
